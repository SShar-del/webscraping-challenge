## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

- Automated browsing (with Splinter) was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted (with Beautiful Soup).

- The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted. 

- The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structureâ€”specifically, a list of dictionaries, articles_info.


## Part 1: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

- The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame, mars_temp_df. Beautiful Soup was used to scrape the data. The columns were given the required headings and data types.

The data was analyzed to answer the following questions:  

- How many months exist on Mars? 
- How many Martian days' worth of data are there? 

The data was analyzed to answer the following questions, and a data visualization was created to support each answer:  

- Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest?  

- Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?
- How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate was made.

- The DataFrame was exported into a CSV file, mars_temp.csv.
